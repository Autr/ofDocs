See ````draw()````\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this application you will see the following:\n\n* Openframeworks has no window.\n* CommandLine is running as expected.\n\n\n\nWhen the key ````r```` is pressed:\n\n* Attention keystrokes will not have effect!\n\n* the counter is NOT set to 0.\nSee ````keyPressed()````\n\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Running the application will result in a commandline displaying a constantly increasing number.\n* Close the program by pressing ````ESC````\n\n\n### Other classes used in this file\n\nofAppNoWindow.","type":"page","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
