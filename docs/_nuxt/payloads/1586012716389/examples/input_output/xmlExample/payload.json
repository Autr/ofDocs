Objectives\n\nThis example demonstrates how to read and write an xml file to the file system leveraging ```ofXML```. \n\nIn the code, pay attention to: \n\n* Use ```ofXML``` to read an xml file from the file system with ```XML.load(\"mySettings.xml\")```\n* Writing an xml file to the file system with ```XML.save(\"mySettings.xml\")```\n\n* Adding childNodes to the xml with ```XML.addChild``` and appending with ```XML.addXML```\n* Parsing and traversing XML with ```XML.exists()```, ```XML.getValue()```, ```XML.setToSibling()```,```XML.setToParent()```, ```XML.setTo()```,```XML.getName()``` \n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app for the first time, you will see a screen with:\n\n* A black background, with a thin column on the left and a large filled rect on the right\n* Text instructions at the top and at the bottom of the screen. \n* A line drawn on the right canvas \n\nWhen the mouse is pressed, the application : \n\n* starts to record the drag movement. \n* As the mouse is dragged across the canvas, the path is drawn in a thin stroke to the canvas.\n* The background will changing color randomly with mouse movement\n*  Drag coordinates, along with the background color are captured in an xml structure while dragging\n\nWhen the key ```s``` is pressed:\n\n* The application will save the stored xml data structure into the ```data\\mySetttings.xml``` file. \n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Press down on the canvas with the mouse and start dragging the mouse while holding down. \n* Press ```s``` to save the xml file of the current state to a local xml file\n* Restart the application to see the saved settings of the last drawn recording restored. \n\n\n### Other classes used in this file\n\nThis Example uses no other classes.","type":"folder","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
