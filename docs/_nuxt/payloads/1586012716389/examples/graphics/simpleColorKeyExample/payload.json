Specifically, in this example, blue is keyed out of the original image.\n\nIn this example, pay attention to the following code:\n\n* ```original.getPixels()``` gets the pixels from the original image\n* ```original.getHeight()``` & ```original.getWidth()``` gets the height and width of the original image which is used to traverse the entire image.\n* While traversing the image, ```original.getColor()``` is used get the color value of each pixel using ```original.getColor()```\n* ``` ofPixelsRef pixels``` copies pixels by reference rather than a full copy\n*  ```keyed.setFromPixels(pixels)``` is used to set pixels to an image\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see a screen with the same image of a storm tropper twice. The first image shows a blue background, and in the second image, blue pixels have been keyed out and replaced with black pixels. \n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Press the \"s\" key to save the modified version.\n* You will find the saved file in the bin >> data file. \n\n\n### Other classes used in this file\n\nThis Example does not use any other classes. \n","type":"folder","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
