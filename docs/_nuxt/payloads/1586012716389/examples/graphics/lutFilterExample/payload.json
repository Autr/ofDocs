LUT stands for \"Look Up Table\". Final Image = Source Image + LUT where LUT is the difference bewtween your desired outcome and your source. \n\nIn this example, pay attention to the following code:\n\n* ```void loadLUT(string path)``` \n* ```void applyLUT(ofPixelsRef pix)``` uses ```glm::vec3``` and ```imgageName.setColor(x, y, color)``` to alter the color of every pixel of the image\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see:\n\n* a large image in the center of the screen and a small small image located at the uper left hand corner of this rectangle; both images will have your camera feed showing.
