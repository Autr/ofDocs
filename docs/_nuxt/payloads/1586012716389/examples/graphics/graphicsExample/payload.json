After studying this example, you'll understand how to render some simple colored lines and elementary shapes, such as ellipses and rectangles.\n\nIn the code, pay attention to: \n\n* different commands for setting the active color, such as ```ofSetColor()``` and ```ofSetHexColor()```. These commands set the color for subsequent drawing operations, including lines and fills.\n* toggling transparency, with ```ofEnableAlphaBlending()``` and ```ofDisableAlphaBlending()```\n* toggling of shape fills, with ```ofFill()``` and ```ofNoFill()```\n* toggling the anti-aliasing of lines, with ```ofEnableAntiAliasing()``` and ```ofDisableAntiAliasing()```\n* rendering bitmap text to the screen, with ```ofDrawBitmapString()```.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see a screen with:\n\n* a filled and unfilled (outline) circle\n* a group of 200 randomly-colored, randomly-positioned rectangles\n* some transparent and opaque rectangles\n* some diagonal red lines\n* some bitmap text. \n\nInstructions for using the app:\n\n* Press ```s``` (\"smooth\") to toggle whether or not the red lines are anti-aliased. \n\n### Other classes used in this file\n\nThis example uses no other classes.","type":"folder","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
