Bash lets you run command-line applications and utilities such as <code>mk-dir foo</code> which makes a new directory named <code>foo</code>.  Or you can use the copy command <code>cp</code> or move command <code>mv</code> to copy or move files or directories from one place to another <em>Note: for copying directories you will need to use <code>cp -R</code> for recursive copying.</em>  You can also find out the IP address of your machine by running <code>ifconfig</code> from bash.
