Android Studio should offer to fix these values for you when you open the appropriate build files.\n\n    - The Gradle version specified in `/build.gradle`\n    - The `compileSdkVersion`, `buildToolsVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion` values\n        in `/addons/ofxAndroid/ofAndroidLib/build.gradle` and `/apps/myApps/androidEmptyExample/build.gradle`\n\n- If you get strange linker errors, check that you are using the 15c version of the NDK.
