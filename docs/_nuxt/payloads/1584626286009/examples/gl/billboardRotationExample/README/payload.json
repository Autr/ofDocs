Here the fragment shader is used additionally to apply a rotation to the texture of the snowflakes. Also the particles move with varying velocities depending on the cursor position.\n\nYou will learn how to..\n* use a billboard shader that is able to rotate the applied texture in 2D\n* use a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) to create particles\n* pass a dynamic attribute of the VBO to the shader\n* use a texture to draw the VBO sprites\n* create an animation of repelling particles\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see a window full of snowflakes. Every time a snowflake particle is pushed over a window border, it moves back to its original position from the opposite border. Moving particles should also rotate.\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Move the cursor to shovel the snow.\n\n### Other classes used in this file\n\nThis Example uses the following classes:\n\n* [ofImage](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofImage/)\n* [ofShader](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/gl/ofShader/)\n* [ofVbo](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/gl/ofVbo/)\n","type":"page","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
