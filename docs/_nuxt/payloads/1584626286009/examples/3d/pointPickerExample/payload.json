Each of the points are identifible with their index exposed by mousing near it.\n\n\nIn the code, pay attention to:\n\n* ```ofSetVerticalSync``` to synchronize the redraw of the screen to the vertical refresh of your screen\n* ```mesh.load(\"lofi-bunny.ply\")``` to load a .ply file into the mesh\n* Creation of the wireframe in the mesh using ```mesh.drawWireFrame()````\n* Setting of the point size with ```glPointSize(2)```\n* Drawing of the vertices by the mesh using ```mesh.drawVertices```\n* Use of a camera to render the scene with ```cam.begin()``` and ```cam.end()```\n* Conversion of the vertex from the mesh to screen coordinates to evaluate distance from the mouse with ```cam.worldToScreen(mesh.getVertex(i))```\n* Using ```cur.distance(mouse)``` to determine distance between the mouse coordinates and that of the vertex. Lowest distance is identified as the nearest vertex to the mouse.\n* Drawing of line from the nearest vertex to the mouse using ```ofDrawLine(nearestVertex,mouse)```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see\n\n* A mesh that reflects a low polygon bunny model with points and flat polygons drawn.\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Move the mouse near the points in the mesh to see their index number\n","type":"folder","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
