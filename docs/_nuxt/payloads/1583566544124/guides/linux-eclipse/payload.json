The Java installation instructions for ubuntu referenced on this page are old and for this installation <a href=\"http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-oracle-java-7-in-ubuntu-12-04.html\">these instructions</a> were used.

There are 2 scripts, install_dependencies.sh and install_codecs.sh. You need to run at least install_dependencies.sh and install_codecs.sh will install support for some formats like h264 and mp3. Donâ€™t execute them from the desktop, as they needs root privileges to run, you will need to run them from a terminal. You can execute it more than once without problem if something goes wrong. If you update your openFrameworks version, execute install_dependencies.sh script again. If you are using the tar-zipped downloaded version of openframeworks, at this point, you should be able to build the examples using the makefile from the command line.  If you are using the GitHub version you will have to generate the example projects using projectGenerator or copy the Makefile and config.make from the template if you want to run them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Ubuntu the exact steps are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Ubuntu:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>open a terminal.

In this step you can test if code completion works with Ctrl-Spacebar. e.g. type ofL Ctrl-Space and see if the ofLog method is displayed. You can also see if Eclipse will jump to the declaration of a method or constant by pressing F3 or Ctrl+Left mouse. Compile the code using the Hammer icon. For this example I added a log message to the setup method in the ofApp.cpp file. Make sure you choose the Debug configuration under the arrow of the Hammer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"01addCode.png\" alt=\"add code 1\">\n<img src=\"02addCode.png\" alt=\"add code 2\">\n<img src=\"03addCode.png\" alt=\"add code 3\"></p>\n<p><strong>h) Run and debug the test project</strong></p>\n<p>Activate a breakpoint in the new code by Right-click in the margin and choosing Toggle Breakpoint or double clicking in the margin.
