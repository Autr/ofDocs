Double click to reset the camera.</li>\n<li>Use your keyboard arrow keys to move your &quot;car&quot; around the scene</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other classes used in this file</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>ofEasycam</li>\n<li>ofLight</li>\n<li>Car.h (custom class for the example)</li>\n</ul>\n","type":"folder"}}],"fetch":[]}
