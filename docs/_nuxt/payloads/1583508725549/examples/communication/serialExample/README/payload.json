In this example, you will connect to a serial device, read incoming byte packets from the connected device, and send response messages over serial.\n\nThis example covers the following functions:\n\n* Connecting to a serial device\n* Reading incoming byte packets from the connected device\n* Sending response messages over serial\n* Updating graphics based on the incoming byte information\n\nIn the code, pay attention to:\n\n* Listing all serial devices with ```serial.listDevices()```, which logs a list to the console. Make sure the port ID you specify is the same that your Arduino or other device is connected on.\n* When a device is connected, check the console logs to ensure that you're not getting any Serial connection errors and have successfully connected to the specified port\n* To signal successful communication back to the Arduino, send a trigger message: ```serial.writeByte('a')```\n* Read incoming messages with ```serial.readBytes()```\n* Store incoming messages in an array ```bytesReturned[3]``` to match the set of data being sent from the Arduino sketch. This can be changed to match the size of discrete data packets being sent from Arduino.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see a white screen with gray text showing the following information:\n\n* nBytes read\n* nTimes read\n* read byte\n* time of reading\n\n### Instructions for use:\n\n* Click the mouse to send a communication trigger to Arduino and receive a serial packet in return.
