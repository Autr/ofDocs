(see also ``soundPlayerExample``)\n* how to allow the user to move a circle around the screen (that bounces off the window edges) by changing its velocity (depending on the cursor position, see ``mouseDragged()``)\n* how to check for collision (and play a sound if the circle collides with window edges), see ``update()`` function.\n* how to use ``ofSoundGetSpectrum()`` to get a frequency spectrum sample for the FFT.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhenever the white circle collides with the border of the window, a sound should play. Each border (top, bottom, left, and right) corresponds to a different sound file. \n\nIn the center of the window, you should see an FFT visualization of the sounds that are currently played.\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Drag the circle around and release it to make it move around the screen and to play sounds.\n\n### Classes used in this example\n\nThis example uses the following classes: \n\n* ``ofSoundPlayer``","type":"page"}}],"fetch":[]}
