Demonstrates how to load in a model using both ofMesh and ofxAssimpModelLoader.\n\nThe various models were produced by exporting various formats of the same model from blender.\n\nIn the code, pay attention to:\n\n* the usage of the addon ofxAssimpModelLoader, which is used to load in 3D file types including 3ds, .obj, .dae etc. and provide access to their vertices, textures, materials, and animation.\n* how the various models render differently and change axis when loaded.\n* altering the rotation, position, and scale of the model with  ```model.setRotation()```, ```model.setScale()```, and  ```model.setRotation()```.  \n* loading directly into ofMesh, with ```mesh.load(file.ply)``` when key 5 is pressed.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see:\n\n* A spinning penguin.\n* a text overlay with instructions.\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* press the number keys to load various models in different formats.\n* when in mode 6 use easyCam mouse and keyboard navigation to look around the model.\n","type":"page"}}],"fetch":[]}
