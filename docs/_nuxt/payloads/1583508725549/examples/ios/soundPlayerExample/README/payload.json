Tapping on each section should play a sound file – depending on your finger position it will play the sounds at varying speeds and pitches.\n\nInstructions for use:\n\n* Tap in the left area to play the synth sound file. The x-position of where you tapped should change the pan, the y-position changes the speed.\n* Tap in the center area to play the beats. Tap and move up and down to change the playback speed.\n* Tap in the right area to play the vocals. These are set to multiplay, so you can play them at varying speeds several times at once.\n\n### Classes used in this example\n\nThis example uses the following classes: \n\n* ``ofSoundPlayer``","type":"page"}}],"fetch":[]}
