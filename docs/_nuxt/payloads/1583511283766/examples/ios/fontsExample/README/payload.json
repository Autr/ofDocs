In this demonstration, text is drawn in a variety of environments. Additionally, the ```getStringBoundingBox()``` method is used to return an ```ofRectangle``` that can help you further align your text within the application.\n\nThis example covers the following functions:\n\n* ofTrueTypeFont as a data type\n* ````drawString()```\n* ```getStringBoundingBox()```\n\nIn the code, pay attention to:\n\n* Various techniques utilized to position and move the text as applied through a font.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen launching this app, you should see a gray screen with white and pink text displaying a variety of characters and text. The large individual characters should update when the screen is touched/dragged, and the bottom rows of text should display strings in bitmap and vector.\n\n### Instructions for use:\n\n* Watch and behold the magic of rendered fonts on your mobile device.\n\n### Other classes used in this file\n\nThis Example uses the following classes:\n\n* [ofxiOS](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxiOS/) (for compiling openFrameworks to an Apple iOS device)\n","type":"page"}}],"fetch":[]}
