These import the functionality of nine powerful open-source libraries made by other developers, communities and organizations.\n\n```cpp\n#include \"ofxOpenCv.h\"\n#include \"ofxNetwork.h\"\n#include \"ofxOsc.h\"\n#include \"ofxXmlSettings.h\"\n#include \"ofxAssimpModelLoader.h\"\n#include \"ofxThreadedImageLoader.h\"\n#include \"ofxKinect.h\"\n#include \"ofxGui.h\"\n#include \"ofxSvg.h\"\n```\n\nYou'll also see declarations for some instances of objects from these libraries:\n\n```\n\tofxCvGrayscaleImage cvGray;\n\tofxTCPClient client;\n\tofxTCPServer server;\n\tofxOscSender osc_sender;\n\tofxXmlSettings settings;\n\tofxAssimpModelLoader betterModelLoader;\n\tofxThreadedImageLoader threadedLoader;\n\tofxKinect kinect;\n\tofxPanel gui;\n\tofxSVG svg;\n```\n\nNote that including an addon's `.h` file and declaring an instance one of its objects is *not* sufficient for that addon to work properly!
