install_dependencies.sh script for your distribution which is located in `scripts/linux/distro_name/install_dependencies.sh`\n\nFor example if you are using Ubuntu, open a new console and enter:\n\n```sh\ncd OF/scripts/linux/ubuntu\nsudo ./install_dependencies.sh\n```\n\nNext, if you want to use some formats like mp3, you'll need to run the install_codecs script: it's in the same

We separate them because mp3 and some other formats installed by the script might be protected by patents in some countries and could be problematic to use in commercial work.

You can specify as many as you want but it's recommended to use the number of cores in your computer or less.\n\nWith this you can already go into any of the examples folders and compile the examples using make:\n\n```sh\ncd OF/examples/graphics/polygonExample\nmake\nmake run\n```\n\nOr use the officially supported IDE: [qtcreator](../qtcreator/) which has plugins that allow to create new projects, import existing ones, add addons to them. Eclipse is no longer officially supported. \n\nIf you want to install the project generator, a tool that allows to create and update an OF project, you'll need to run one last script:\n\n```sh\ncd OF/scripts/linux\n./compilePG.sh\n```\n\nThis will compile the GUI version of the project generator which will be placed in the root of the OF folder. When it's done compiling it will ask you if you also want to install the optional command line version of the tool which allows you to create projects from anywhere on your system.\nIf you installed the command line tool and want to change the OF path it uses, you can change the value of PG_OF_PATH in ~/.profile.\n\nRun the commandline project generator without any arguments to see how to use it:\n```sh\nprojectGenerator\n```\n\n---\n\n## Install on Third-Party Linux Distribution\n\nif your linux is third-party distribution, maybe you can see some error while install openFrameworks. this is because installing scripts are using information of kernel and version number that you can check with `lsb_release -a` command on your machine. in this situation, you can install openFrameworks by modifying this information temporarily.\n\nfor example, **Elementary OS 0.3 freya** is based on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**. you can check your linux distro information on official distro websites.\n\n### 1. get your distribution information\nfor revert to back after install oF successfully, you need to copy or make a backup as a file (.bak) of this information.\n\n```sh\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release\nDISTRIB_ID=\"elementary OS\"\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=0.3.2\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=freya\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"elementary OS Freya\"\n$ sudo cp /etc/lsb-release /etc/lsb-release.bak\n```\n\n### 2. get based disribution information\nrun this command on based ditribution machine.\nthis example is **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**:\n\n```sh\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\n```\n\n### 3. modifying kernel information on linux machine will install openFrameworks \nmodifying `/etc/lsb-release` with information from *step 2*.\n\n```sh\n$ sudo vi /etc/lsb-release\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\n```\n\n### 4. install openFrameworks.\ninstall dependencies, codecs and compile openFrameworks and projectGenerator\n\n```sh\n$ ls {OF_DIRECTORY}/scripts/linux/ubuntu\n$ sudo ./install_dependencies.sh\n$ sudo ./install_codecs.sh\n$ ls {OF_DIRECTORY}/scripts/linux\n$ sudo ./compileOF.sh \n$ sudo ./compilePG.sh \n```\n### 5. revert to original \n**don't forget this step!**\n\n```sh\n$ sudo cp /etc/lsb-release.bak /etc/lsb-release\n```\n","type":"page","static":true}}],"fetch":[]}
