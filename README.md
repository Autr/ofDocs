# ofDocs - App

[ofDocs](https://github.com/Autr/ofDocs) is an alternative documentation, examples and code browser for [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), which mirrors a list of files and folders into a website using Nuxt and Vue. Currently it is set up to serve documentation from ofSite, READMEs and code from the [openFrameworks repository](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks), and optionally [user-installed addons](https://ofxaddons.com). 

When running ofDocs locally, changes to markdown files can be made from within the app and viewed instantly. A static version can be also generated using Nuxt. The structure of files and folders will are parsed into HTML and JSON that can be hosted on a standard LAMP server, or on Github Pages:

### [ofDocs (static documentation)](https://ofdocs.autr.tv)
### [ofDocsApp (nuxt.js application)](https://github.com/autr/ofdocs)
